#### CGDraw

CGDraw turns drawings in Adobe Illustrator into code. Objective-C or
Swift. AppKit or UIKit.

It's kind of like [drawscript](http://drawscri.pt) with less features or
[paintcode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com) with way less features. But
open source.

Notes:

Uses c-level drawing commands rather than UIBezier/NSBezier because
they take up much less space and are the same across both platforms.

#### Install:

Place `CGDraw.jsx` in your Illustrator scripts folder. On OS X, the
scripts folder should be something like
`/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC/Presets.localized/en_US/Scripts`.
